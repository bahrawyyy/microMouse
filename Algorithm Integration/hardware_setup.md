## Hardware Setup

To build the hardware-integrated Micromouse robot, you will need the following components:

- **2 N20 Motors:** These motors will drive the robot's movement.
- **Magnetic Encoders:** These encoders will help measure the wheel's rotation and enable precise control.
- **MPU6050:** This sensor provides accelerometer and gyroscope data for orientation and motion tracking.
- **3 Ultrasonic Sensors:** These sensors are used for obstacle detection and navigation.
- **Batteries:** Choose appropriate batteries to power the motors and electronics.
- **Caster Wheel:** A caster wheel is essential for smooth movement and stability.

Follow these steps to set up the hardware components:

1. **Motor Installation:**
   - Attach the N20 motors to the robot's chassis.
   - Ensure that the motors are securely mounted and aligned for proper movement.

2. **Encoder Installation:**
   - Mount the magnetic encoders to the motor shafts.
   - Make sure the encoders are firmly attached and aligned with the wheels.

3. **Sensor Integration:**
   - Connect the MPU6050 to the microcontroller (e.g., Arduino) using the appropriate communication protocol (e.g., I2C).
   - Attach the three ultrasonic sensors to the robot's front, left, and right sides.
   - Ensure the sensors have a clear line of sight and are securely fastened.

4. **Power Supply:**
   - Choose and connect suitable batteries to power both the motors and the electronics.
   - Make sure the voltage levels are appropriate for the components used.

5. **Caster Wheel Placement:**
   - Attach the caster wheel to the front or rear of the robot, depending on your design.
   - This wheel provides stability and supports smooth turns.

6. **Wiring and Connections:**
   - Carefully route and organize the wiring to avoid tangling or interference.
   - Double-check all connections for correctness and secure them properly.

7. **Final Checks:**
   - Before powering on the robot, ensure that all components are in their correct positions and securely fastened.
   - Verify that there are no loose parts that could cause issues during operation.

Once you have completed the hardware setup, you can proceed to program and test your Micromouse robot's functionality. Be sure to refer to the project-specific documentation for coding instructions and examples tailored to your hardware configuration.

**Note:** Always exercise caution when working with electronic components and power sources. Follow safety guidelines and take necessary precautions to prevent damage to your components and ensure personal safety.
